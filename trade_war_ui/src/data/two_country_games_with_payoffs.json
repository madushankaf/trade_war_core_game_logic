    "rationale":"The OPEN DIALOGUE strategy, as a cooperative approach, primarily transmits its effects through reduced uncertainty, improved price stability, and potential increases in trade volumes. By fostering direct communication, both the United States and China can address tariff disputes and non-tariff barriers, which may stabilize exchange rates and support productivity growth, especially in sectors like technology, agriculture, and manufacturing that are highly exposed to bilateral trade. In the short term (0\u201312 months), GDP growth is likely to see a modest positive impact as business confidence improves and supply chain disruptions ease, while the trade balance may shift slightly in favor of the US due to reduced retaliatory measures. Over the medium term (1\u20133 years), sustained dialogue could further enhance market access and investment flows, though gains may be tempered by ongoing geopolitical tensions. Retaliation risks are lower compared to defective strategies, and diplomatic relations are likely to improve, reducing the likelihood of sudden policy shocks. Historical precedent from the post-2018 US-China trade tensions shows that periods of dialogue, even amid broader disputes, have led to temporary stabilization in trade flows and market sentiment. Key assumptions include both parties' willingness to engage constructively and the absence of major external shocks; the largest uncertainties stem from potential shifts in domestic political priorities or unexpected escalations in other policy areas.",

Sectors most impacted are those sensitive to global demand and supply fluctuations, such as petrochemicals and non-oil exports, but the lack of active measures means stakeholders experience continuity rather than disruption. In the short term (0\u201312 months), GDP and trade balance are expected to remain stable, as no new barriers or incentives alter trade dynamics; in the medium term (1\u20133 years), this stance preserves flexibility for future policy shifts but may forgo opportunities for proactive gains. Retaliation or spillover risks are low, as the policy is non-confrontational and signals diplomatic openness, aligning with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030 goals to diversify exports. Historical trade data from the Saudi General Authority for Statistics shows that periods of policy stability have not led to significant volatility in trade with BRICS partners. Key assumptions include stable global demand and no external shocks; the largest uncertainty is the potential for unforeseen geopolitical developments to disrupt this equilibrium.",

    "rationale":"Imposing sanctions on Russia by Saudi Arabia would primarily affect trade volumes and prices, with immediate disruptions in bilateral trade flows, especially in sectors such as energy, petrochemicals, and machinery. The primary transmission channels would be reduced export and import volumes, potential price volatility in global oil markets, and adverse effects on exchange rates due to heightened uncertainty. In the short term (0\u201312 months), GDP is likely to contract due to lost export opportunities and higher input costs for industries reliant on Russian goods, while the trade balance would deteriorate as both exports and imports decline. Over the medium term (1\u20133 years), persistent sanctions could lead to further GDP losses and a continued negative trade balance, unless alternative markets are found. Retaliation risks are significant, as Russia could impose countermeasures or disrupt multilateral cooperation, amplifying diplomatic tensions and spillover effects within BRICS and OPEC frameworks. Historical precedents from the retrieved sources indicate that inflation and exchange rate volatility are common outcomes when trade with BRICS partners is disrupted, and that political instability can further exacerbate economic losses. Key assumptions include the absence of immediate alternative markets and the expectation that Russia will respond with reciprocal measures. The largest uncertainties involve the scale of global market reactions and the potential for third-party mediation.",

    "move":"SUBSIDIZE EXPORT",
    "strategy_type":"cooperative",
    "rationale":"Subsidizing exports in Saudi Arabia primarily transmits through price competitiveness, as subsidies lower the effective cost of Saudi goods in international markets, potentially increasing export volumes and improving the trade balance in the short term (0\u201312 months). The most affected sectors are non-oil industries, which have seen significant growth, with non-oil exports rising from USD 57 billion in 2018 to USD 85 billion in 2022, indicating strong responsiveness to supportive policies. Key stakeholders include exporters, industrial firms, and government fiscal authorities. In the medium term (1\u20133 years), GDP is likely to benefit from higher export-driven output, but gains may moderate if trading partners, such as Russia, retaliate or if global demand softens. Retaliation risks include Russia imposing countermeasures or challenging subsidies at the WTO, which could dampen diplomatic relations and partially offset trade gains. Historical data from the Saudi Exports Development Authority (2023) shows that export promotion has contributed to diversification and growth, but the sustainability of gains depends on careful fiscal management and global market conditions. The largest uncertainties are the scale of Russia\u2019s response, the persistence of global inflation, and the ability of Saudi firms to maintain productivity gains. Assumptions include stable global demand and no immediate large-scale retaliation.",

    "move":"IMPOSE QUOTA",
    "strategy_type":"defective",
    "rationale":"Imposing a quota on imports from Russia would primarily affect trade volumes, leading to reduced import quantities and potential price increases for restricted goods. The most affected sectors would be those reliant on Russian imports, such as certain industrial inputs or agricultural products, with downstream effects on domestic producers and consumers. In the short term (0\u201312 months), the quota could marginally improve Saudi Arabia\u2019s trade balance by curbing imports, but it may also raise input costs and disrupt supply chains, slightly dampening GDP growth. Over the medium term (1\u20133 years), persistent quotas could incentivize domestic substitution or sourcing from alternative partners, but risk retaliatory measures from Russia, potentially affecting Saudi non-oil exports and broader diplomatic relations. Historical trade data from the Saudi General Authority for Statistics and the Saudi Exports Development Authority indicate that restrictive measures can yield modest trade balance gains but often at the expense of export competitiveness and political goodwill. Key assumptions include stable global demand and no immediate large-scale retaliation; the largest uncertainties involve Russia\u2019s response and the adaptability of Saudi industries to new sourcing. Policymakers must weigh these risks against potential short-term political gains and the alignment with Vision 2030\u2019s non-oil export objectives.",
